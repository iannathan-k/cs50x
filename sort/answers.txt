sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: it works fast on sorted-list, but slow (N^2) on
random and reversed lists.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: the algorithm is much faster than sort3 and it's
always fast regardless the list is already sorted or not. The fast
algorithm is likely due to the O(n log n) algorithm.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: the algorithm is much slower than sort2 and it's
always that slow regardless the list is already sorted or not. The
slow algorithm is likely due to the O(n^2) algorithm in the worst
and average cases.
